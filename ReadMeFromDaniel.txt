1. Finished exam creation process, for each screen I've added an errorMap which validates the user input. - gotta add a preview option before submitting. 
2. Added javadoc to all the classes that I have created during the prototype phase aswell as everything that I did afterwards.
3. Organized the code in each controller that I've made, splitted into more methods so the code would be more modular. 
4. Related to 1 - added queries to update tables exam and exam_question in the database.
